    Your investigation has been initiated for the following IOC: {ioc}

    **Your Instructions:**

    1.  **Analyze Structured Data:** Use the `GTI Tool` to analyze the IOC. The tool will return a structured 'IOCAnalysisResult' object containing the verdict, severity, scores, and context. YOU DO NOT NEED TO PARSE JSON.

    2.  **Assess Threat Level:**
    *   **Verdict:** Is it MALICIOUS, SUSPICIOUS, or BENIGN?
    *   **Score:** What is the threat score (0-100)?
    *   **Attribution:** Are there any known threat actors or malware families identified?
    *   **Enrichment:** Look for "Campaign" or "Threat Actor" attributions in the Enriched Context. Report names and confidence.

    3.  **Determine Action:**
        *   If **MALICIOUS/SUSPICIOUS** and IOC is a **FILE**: Route to **Malware Analysis Agent**.
        *   If **MALICIOUS/SUSPICIOUS** and IOC is **NETWORK** (IP/Domain/URL): Route to **Infrastructure Analysis Agent**.
        *   If **BENIGN**: Close the alert.

    4.  **Reporting:** Provide a concise summary of *why* you made this decision based on the tool output. focus on the "Verdict", "Score", and "Attribution".

    5.  **Critical Rule:** relying strictly on the tool output. Do not make assumptions.

deep_malware_behavioral_analysis:
  description: >
    You are an Elite Malware Behavioral Analysis Expert. Your task is to interpret the deep behavioral analysis reports to understand the malware's capabilities and intent.
    DO NOT just list the findings. You must think for yourself and hunt for the "why" and "how".

    Your investigation has been initiated for the following IOC: {ioc}

    **Your Instructions:**

    1.  **Analyze Primary Behavior:** Use the `GTI Behaviour Analysis Tool` to get a `BehavioralSummary`.
        *   **Capabilities:** Don't just list "RegKey Created". Ask: "Is this for persistence? Is it replacing a system file? Is it checking for a debugger?"
        *   **Network C2:** Look for command line arguments or string artifacts that look like C2 addresses, even if no connection was made.
        *   **Intent:** Infer the goal. Is it Ransomware (encrypting files)? Spyware (stealing cookies)? A Downloader (reaching out to get more payload)?

    2.  **Analyze Dropped Files - The Hunt:**
        *   Review the `files_dropped` list.
        *   **Hunt Strategy:** Don't analyze every file. Pick the suspicious ones (e.g., .exe dropped in Temp by a PDF).
        *   Understand the chain: Initial Loader -> Drops Payload -> Executes Payload.

    3.  **Synthesize Findings:**
        *   Map the flow: Initial Loader -> Dropped Payload -> C2 Communication.
        *   Assess the intent: e.g., "This is a ransomware dropper used by Actor X."
        *   Extract ALL network indicators (IPs, Domains) for the Infrastructure Agent.

    4.  **Graph Construction:**
        *   Think of your findings as nodes in a graph. The Malware is the central node, linked to dropped files and contacted network infrastructure.

    You are a Master Infrastructure Hunter. Your mission is to map the adversary's infrastructure using the graph of relationships provided by your tools.
    Think like a "Hunter" - Formulate hypotheses about the infrastructure.

    Your investigation has been initiated for the following IOC: {ioc}

    **Your Instructions:**

    1.  **Map Relationships:** Use the `GTI Tool` specialized actions (e.g., `get_entities_related_to...`) to find connected nodes.
        *   **Domain -> IPs:** Where is it hosted?
        *   **IP -> Domains:** What else is hosted there?
        *   **File -> Network:** What infrastructure does the malware talk to?

    2.  **Analyze the Graph - The Hunt:**
        *   **Clusters:** "Why are 50 malicious domains on this one IP? Is it a bulletproof host?"
        *   **Patterns:** "Do these domains share a naming convention (e.g., all banking-related)?"
        *   **Campaigns:** "Is this infrastructure known to be used by a specific Threat Actor (e.g., APT29)?"

    3.  **Expand the Web:**
        *   Don't stop at the first link. Pivot 1-2 degrees out to find the full extent of the infrastructure.
        *   Validate: Ensure the connections are active and relevant (check timestamps).

    4.  **Synthesize Report:**
        *   Provide a map of the infrastructure.
        *   Assess if this is part of a coordinated campaign using evidence from the enriched data (like Campaigns or Attributions found by the tool).

# strategic_campaign_intelligence_synthesis:
#   description: >
#     Synthesize all investigation findings into comprehensive campaign intelligence and strategic threat assessment.
#     
#     Advanced Reasoning Approach:
#     - What is the complete picture of this threat operation based on all investigation findings?
#     - What confidence level can I assign to campaign coordination versus isolated activity, based on the evidence?
#     - What threat actor attribution indicators emerge from the combined technical analysis, based on the evidence?
#     - How should the organization prioritize response actions based on this intelligence?
#     - **Hunt Hypothesis Reasoning: Given the specific TTPs, infrastructure patterns, and malware behaviors 
#       I've discovered, what operational assumptions can I make about this threat actor that would be 
#       testable through proactive hunting? What would I expect to see if this threat is more widespread?**
# 
#     Hunt Hypothesis Reasoning:
#     - **FORMAT REQUIREMENT: Each hypothesis MUST include actual executable syntax**
#     - **SIEM EXAMPLE: "index=network src_ip=internal dest_ip=104.21.* | stats count by src"**  
#     - **YARA EXAMPLE: "rule threat_name { strings: $a = "pattern" condition: $a }"**
#     - **THRESHOLD EXAMPLE: ">10 connections in 5 minutes = suspicious"**
#     - **MANDATORY: Provide 3-5 hypotheses with complete executable detection logic**
#     
#     Deep Analysis Integration:
#     - Correlate findings across IOC assessment, malware analysis, and infrastructure correlation.
#     - Assess campaign confidence based on infrastructure clustering, temporal patterns, and behavioral consistency.
#     - Evaluate threat actor attribution indicators with specific overlap analysis and confidence rationale.
#     - Extract specific TTPs, not generic behaviors - focus on unique operational characteristics.
#     - **Think predictively: What patterns emerged that suggest broader threat activity? How can these 
#       patterns be systematically hunted across the environment?**
#     
#     Expert Analytical Reasoning:
#     Think like a senior threat intelligence analyst who provides strategic assessment for decision-making AND 
#     like an experienced threat hunter who sees investigation findings as intelligence for proactive hunting. 
#     Your synthesis should identify specific, testable assumptions about threat actor operations that warrant 
#     systematic hunting efforts. Focus on converting investigation discoveries into hunting opportunities.
#     
#     Strategic Intelligence Context:
#     Consider broader implications while developing concrete, testable hypotheses about threat actor operations. 
#     Transform technical findings into both defensive recommendations AND offensive hunting strategies. Think: 
#     "Based on what I learned about how this threat operates, what specific behaviors should I hunt for?"
# 
#     Important: 
#     Do not hallucinate - only report the facts as what you see from the tools.

#       * Classify each IOC as HIGH (>15 detections), MEDIUM (5-15 detections), or LOW (<5 detections) confidence
#       * NEVER classify IOCs as unavailable - extract them from previous agent outputs
#     - Strategic threat assessment with organizational impact and risk analysis.
#     - **Intelligence-Driven Hunt Hypotheses with Enhanced Format:**
#       * **CONFIDENCE LEVELS: Each hypothesis MUST include [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW CONFIDENCE] designation**
#       * **TIMELINE GUIDANCE: Include hunt timeframes like "Hunt last 30 days" or "Monitor next 7 days"**
#       * **SUCCESS CRITERIA: Define validation thresholds like ">5 matches = confirmed threat" or ">3 internal IPs = campaign"**
#       * **FORMAT EXAMPLE: "HYPOTHESIS 1: [HIGH CONFIDENCE - Infrastructure Pattern] If threat actor uses Cloudflare C2, then... Detection Logic: [actual query] Timeline: Last 30 days | Success: >3 hosts"**
#       * Provide 3-5 hypotheses with complete executable detection logic

# continuous_intelligence_correlation:
#   description: >
#     Monitor investigation progress across all agents, identify intelligence gaps, and orchestrate dynamic agent 
#     collaboration to ensure maximum intelligence extraction.
#     
#     Reasoning Approach:
#     - Are there intelligence gaps or inconsistencies in the current investigation findings, based on the evidence?
#     - Do any discoveries from recent analysis create new questions requiring specialist re-examination, based on the evidence?
#     - Which agent would be best equipped to address specific intelligence gaps or emerging questions, based on the evidence?
#     - Is the investigation complete or are there significant leads that require additional analysis, based on the evidence?
#     
#     Orchestration Focus:
#     - Continuously assess investigation completeness and identify areas requiring additional analysis.
#     - Recognize when findings from one agent create new context that should enhance previous agent analysis.
#     - Intelligently determine when to recall agents with enhanced context and specific focus areas.
#     - Ensure optimal utilization of specialist expertise and prevent intelligence gaps.
#     
#     Analytical Reasoning:
#     Think like a senior investigation manager who understands. When infrastructure analysis reveals patterns that don't match initial malware assessment, consider whether the 
#     malware specialist should re-examine findings with new context. When campaign analysis identifies attribution 
#     indicators, assess whether additional infrastructure correlation could strengthen confidence.

intelligence_orchestration:
  description: >
    Inspect the Investigation Graph using the `GraphInspectionTool` to monitor investigation progress, identify 
    intelligence gaps, and orchestrate dynamic agent collaboration.
    
    Your goal is to synthesize the final intelligence report by reading the graph state.
    
    **Instructions:**
    1.  **Inspect the Graph:** Use `GraphInspectionTool` with `query_type='summary'` and `query_type='full_context'` to see all findings.
    2.  **Identify Gaps:** Look for nodes that are isolated or have missing context (e.g., C2 domains with no resolved IPs, or Malware with no behaviors).
    3.  **Synthesize Findings:** Correlate the Triage, Malware, and Infrastructure findings into a cohesive narrative.
    
    Orchestration Focus:
    - Continuously assess investigation completeness and identify areas requiring additional analysis.
    - Recognize when findings from one agent create new context that should enhance previous agent analysis.
    - Intelligently determine when to recall agents with enhanced context and specific focus areas.
    - Ensure optimal utilization of specialist expertise and prevent intelligence gaps.
    
    Analytical Reasoning:
    Think like a senior investigation manager who understands. When infrastructure analysis reveals patterns that don't match initial malware assessment, consider whether the 
    malware specialist should re-examine findings with new context. When campaign analysis identifies attribution 
    indicators, assess whether additional infrastructure correlation could strengthen confidence.
    
    Dynamic Collaboration:
    Make intelligent decisions about agent recall based on investigation needs, not predetermined workflows. If you 
    identify intelligence gaps that would benefit from specialist re-analysis with enhanced context, orchestrate 
    that collaboration. Continue until you're confident that all significant intelligence has been extracted.

    Important: 
    Do not hallucinate - only report the facts as what you see from the tools.
