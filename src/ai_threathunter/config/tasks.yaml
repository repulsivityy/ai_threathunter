  description: >
    You are an automated Tier 1 SOC Analyst agent. Your task is to parse a raw JSON output from the Google Threat Intelligence API, provide a concise triage summary, and determine the correct next step in the investigative workflow.
    
    Your investigation has been initiated for the following IOC: {ioc}


    Your instructions are as follows:

    1.  **Identify IOC Type:** First, inspect the JSON and identify the IOC type by reading the value at the path `data.type`. It will be 'file', 'url', 'domain', or 'ip_address'.

    2.  **Extract Key Data based on Type:** Based on the type, follow the specific parsing path to extract the required triage information.

    **If `data.type` == "file":**
    * **GTI Verdict:** Get from `data.attributes.gti_assessment.verdict.value`.
    * **GTI Severity:** Get from `data.attributes.gti_assessment.severity.value`.
    * **Detection Ratio:** Use `data.attributes.last_analysis_stats` to calculate the `malicious` ratio.
    * **Threat Names:** Get the list of names from `data.attributes.popular_threat_classification.suggested_threat_label`.
    * **Key Context:** Check if `data.attributes.malware_config` exists. If so, extract C2 hostnames.
    * **Justification:** Summarize the `data.attributes.gti_assessment.description`.

    **If `data.type` is "url", "domain", or "ip_address":**
    * **GTI Verdict:** Get from `data.attributes.gti_assessment.verdict.value`.
    * **GTI Severity:** Get from `data.attributes.gti_assessment.severity.value`.
    * **Detection Ratio:** Use `data.attributes.last_analysis_stats` to calculate the `malicious` ratio.
    * **Key Context:** For domains, note WHOIS creation date. For IPs, note the AS Owner. For URLs, note the final HTTP status code.
    * **Justification:** Summarize the `data.attributes.gti_assessment.description`.

    3.  **Synthesize, Report, and Route:** Use the extracted data to generate a structured report. The "Recommended Action" must be chosen based on the following routing logic:
        * If **GTI Verdict is MALICIOUS** and the **IOC Type is 'file'**, the recommended action is to hand off to the **Malware Analysis Agent**.
        * If **GTI Verdict is MALICIOUS** and the **IOC Type is 'url', 'domain', or 'ip_address'**, the recommended action is to hand off to the **Adversary Infra Hunting Agent**.
        * If **GTI Verdict is BENIGN**, the recommended action is to **close the alert**.
        * For any other case (e.g., suspicious, low confidence), recommend **escalation to a human Tier 2 Analyst**.

# infrastructure_campaign_correlation:
#   description: >
#     Conduct advanced infrastructure correlation analysis using intelligence from previous investigation phases.
#     
#     Reasoning Approach:
#     - How is the discovered infrastructure being used across the broader threat landscape, based on the tool output?
#     - Are there patterns indicating coordinated campaign activity or infrastructure reuse, based on the tool output?
#     - What other malware or threat activities are utilizing the same infrastructure resources, based on the tool output?
#     - How can I map the complete infrastructure network supporting this threat operation, based on the tool output?
#     
#     Investigation Focus:
#     - Execute intelligent URLScan correlation queries based on discovered infrastructure targets.
#     - PRIORITIZE page.ip and server.ip queries to find OTHER MALWARE using same infrastructure.
#     - Use page.ip:<ip> to find malware/pages that contact discovered IPs (CRITICAL for campaign detection).
#     - Use server.ip:<ip> to find what else is hosted on discovered IPs.
#     - Analyze temporal patterns, ASN clustering, and infrastructure deployment coordination, based on the tool output.
#     - Identify campaign-scale infrastructure patterns and threat operation coordination, based on the tool output.
#     
#     Analytical Reasoning:
#     Think like a master infrastructure hunter who understands that infrastructure tells the story of threat 
#     operations. Use the behavioral context from malware analysis to guide your correlation strategy. When malware 
#     analysis reveals C2 communication patterns, focus your URLScan queries on finding other threats using the 
#     same communication infrastructure, based on the tool output.
#     
#     CRITICAL QUERY PRIORITIES:
#     - page.ip:<discovered_ip> (HIGHEST PRIORITY: find other malware using this IP)
#     - server.ip:<discovered_ip> (find what else is hosted on this IP)  
#     - Investigate ALL IPs found in VirusTotal analysis, not just the most recent.
#     - Use temporal correlation: date ranges around malware first-seen dates.
#     - For large ASNs, add date filters to focus on recent suspicious activity.
#     
#     Intelligence Application:
#     Apply the behavioral intelligence from malware analysis to make your infrastructure queries more targeted and 
#     effective. If you know how malware uses specific infrastructure, search for other activities using the same 
#     patterns. Focus on infrastructure relationship mapping rather than generic scanning, based on the tool output.
# 
#     Important: 
#     Do not hallucinate - only report the facts as what you see from the tools.
#   expected_output: >
#     Comprehensive infrastructure correlation report including:
#     - Complete infrastructure relationship mapping with confidence assessments, based on the tool output.
#     - Campaign clustering analysis with evidence of coordination or infrastructure reuse, based on the tool output.
#     - Additional IOCs discovered through infrastructure correlation with relationship context, based on the tool output.
#     - ASN and hosting pattern analysis with clustering significance, based on the tool output.
#     - Temporal correlation analysis showing deployment timing and coordination patterns, based on the tool output.
#     - Infrastructure usage context from malware behavioral analysis integration, based on the tool output.
#     - Campaign-scale infrastructure assessment with scope and distribution analysis, based on the tool output.
# 
# strategic_campaign_intelligence_synthesis:
#   description: >
#     Synthesize all investigation findings into comprehensive campaign intelligence and strategic threat assessment.
#     
#     Advanced Reasoning Approach:
#     - What is the complete picture of this threat operation based on all investigation findings?
#     - What confidence level can I assign to campaign coordination versus isolated activity, based on the evidence?
#     - What threat actor attribution indicators emerge from the combined technical analysis, based on the evidence?
#     - How should the organization prioritize response actions based on this intelligence?
#     - **Hunt Hypothesis Reasoning: Given the specific TTPs, infrastructure patterns, and malware behaviors 
#       I've discovered, what operational assumptions can I make about this threat actor that would be 
#       testable through proactive hunting? What would I expect to see if this threat is more widespread?**
# 
#     Hunt Hypothesis Reasoning:
#     - **FORMAT REQUIREMENT: Each hypothesis MUST include actual executable syntax**
#     - **SIEM EXAMPLE: "index=network src_ip=internal dest_ip=104.21.* | stats count by src"**  
#     - **YARA EXAMPLE: "rule threat_name { strings: $a = "pattern" condition: $a }"**
#     - **THRESHOLD EXAMPLE: ">10 connections in 5 minutes = suspicious"**
#     - **MANDATORY: Provide 3-5 hypotheses with complete executable detection logic**
#     
#     Deep Analysis Integration:
#     - Correlate findings across IOC assessment, malware analysis, and infrastructure correlation.
#     - Assess campaign confidence based on infrastructure clustering, temporal patterns, and behavioral consistency.
#     - Evaluate threat actor attribution indicators with specific overlap analysis and confidence rationale.
#     - Extract specific TTPs, not generic behaviors - focus on unique operational characteristics.
#     - **Think predictively: What patterns emerged that suggest broader threat activity? How can these 
#       patterns be systematically hunted across the environment?**
#     
#     Expert Analytical Reasoning:
#     Think like a senior threat intelligence analyst who provides strategic assessment for decision-making AND 
#     like an experienced threat hunter who sees investigation findings as intelligence for proactive hunting. 
#     Your synthesis should identify specific, testable assumptions about threat actor operations that warrant 
#     systematic hunting efforts. Focus on converting investigation discoveries into hunting opportunities.
#     
#     Strategic Intelligence Context:
#     Consider broader implications while developing concrete, testable hypotheses about threat actor operations. 
#     Transform technical findings into both defensive recommendations AND offensive hunting strategies. Think: 
#     "Based on what I learned about how this threat operates, what specific behaviors should I hunt for?"
# 
#     Important: 
#     Do not hallucinate - only report the facts as what you see from the tools.
# 
#   expected_output: >
#     Authoritative strategic intelligence assessment including:
#     - Executive summary with key findings and threat level assessment.
#     - Campaign classification with confidence scoring and detailed supporting evidence.
#     - Deep attack chain analysis with specific TTPs and behavioral context (not generic descriptions).
#     - Threat actor attribution assessment with confidence levels, specific overlap indicators, and attribution rationale.
#     - **MANDATORY: Complete actionable IOC extraction from ALL previous agent findings:**
#       * Extract EVERY hash, IP, domain, and URL mentioned by previous agents
#       * **FORMAT REQUIREMENT: "IOC: [indicator] | Type: [type] | Confidence: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] | Detections: [X/Y] | Action: [block/monitor]"**
#       * Include detection ratios, first seen dates, and relationship context for each IOC
#       * Classify each IOC as HIGH (>15 detections), MEDIUM (5-15 detections), or LOW (<5 detections) confidence
#       * NEVER classify IOCs as unavailable - extract them from previous agent outputs
#     - Strategic threat assessment with organizational impact and risk analysis.
#     - **Intelligence-Driven Hunt Hypotheses with Enhanced Format:**
#       * **CONFIDENCE LEVELS: Each hypothesis MUST include [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW CONFIDENCE] designation**
#       * **TIMELINE GUIDANCE: Include hunt timeframes like "Hunt last 30 days" or "Monitor next 7 days"**
#       * **SUCCESS CRITERIA: Define validation thresholds like ">5 matches = confirmed threat" or ">3 internal IPs = campaign"**
#       * **FORMAT EXAMPLE: "HYPOTHESIS 1: [HIGH CONFIDENCE - Infrastructure Pattern] If threat actor uses Cloudflare C2, then... Detection Logic: [actual query] Timeline: Last 30 days | Success: >3 hosts"**
#       * Provide 3-5 hypotheses with complete executable detection logic
#     - Recommended immediate actions prioritized by confidence and organizational risk.
#     - Intelligence gaps identification and recommendations for continued monitoring.
# 
# continuous_intelligence_correlation:
#   description: >
#     Monitor investigation progress across all agents, identify intelligence gaps, and orchestrate dynamic agent 
#     collaboration to ensure maximum intelligence extraction.
#     
#     Reasoning Approach:
#     - Are there intelligence gaps or inconsistencies in the current investigation findings, based on the evidence?
#     - Do any discoveries from recent analysis create new questions requiring specialist re-examination, based on the evidence?
#     - Which agent would be best equipped to address specific intelligence gaps or emerging questions, based on the evidence?
#     - Is the investigation complete or are there significant leads that require additional analysis, based on the evidence?
#     
#     Orchestration Focus:
#     - Continuously assess investigation completeness and identify areas requiring additional analysis.
#     - Recognize when findings from one agent create new context that should enhance previous agent analysis.
#     - Intelligently determine when to recall agents with enhanced context and specific focus areas.
#     - Ensure optimal utilization of specialist expertise and prevent intelligence gaps.
#     
#     Analytical Reasoning:
#     Think like a senior investigation manager who understands. When infrastructure analysis reveals patterns that don't match initial malware assessment, consider whether the 
#     malware specialist should re-examine findings with new context. When campaign analysis identifies attribution 
#     indicators, assess whether additional infrastructure correlation could strengthen confidence.
#     
#     Dynamic Collaboration:
#     Make intelligent decisions about agent recall based on investigation needs, not predetermined workflows. If you 
#     identify intelligence gaps that would benefit from specialist re-analysis with enhanced context, orchestrate 
#     that collaboration. Continue until you're confident that all significant intelligence has been extracted.
# 
#     Important: 
#     Do not hallucinate - only report the facts as what you see from the tools.
# 
#   expected_output: >
#     Investigation orchestration assessment including:
#     - Intelligence gap analysis with specific areas requiring additional investigation, based on the evidence.
#     - Agent recall recommendations with enhanced context and specific focus areas, based on the evidence.
