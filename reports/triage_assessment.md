**Verdict:** **MALICIOUS**

**Justification:** The domain received a threat score of 75 and a "MALICIOUS" verdict from the Google Threat Intelligence tool. The justification is based on multiple high-confidence findings, including detection by Google Safe Browsing, classification as malicious by a Mandiant analyst, and direct association with the Russian state-sponsored threat actor UNC4057 (also known as COLDRIVER) and related campaigns.

**Recommended Action:** **Hand off to Infrastructure Analysis**
