### Infrastructure and Campaign Analysis Report
**Initial IOC Assessment:**
- **IOC:** `5329d4b1d8aa6b3e90176927c2597f28c7173f9293304504f9c3a426c821c93d` (trojan.ninjasor)
- **GTI Summary:** The initial IOC is a malicious file, specifically an Adware/PUP dropper with infostealer capabilities. It communicates with the C2 domain `d.ninja-browser.com` to download a second-stage payload. This domain is flagged for being associated with malicious file communications and downloads.

**Infrastructure Relationship Mapping:**
- The malware sample `5329d4b1d8aa...` communicates with:
  - Domain `d.ninja-browser.com` (GTI Verdict: Malicious Associations)
    - This domain was registered on September 23, 2024, through a Russian registrar (REG.RU) with privacy protection.
    - It resolves to IP `89.111.170.193`.
- The malware analysis also identified two other associated IP addresses, though their specific roles could not be confirmed due to tool limitations:
  - IP `152.42.139.18`
  - IP `134.209.139.11`

**Campaign Correlation Assessment:**
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Evidence:** The evidence points to a coordinated campaign centered around the "NinjaBrowser" adware. The primary evidence is the shared infrastructure used by the malware sample. The C2 domain `d.ninja-browser.com` and its resolving IP `89.111.170.193`, along with the other hardcoded IPs, are all linked to the same malicious payload. The recent, privacy-protected registration of the domain is also a common tactic for campaign operators. While the inability to inspect the IPs for other co-hosted domains prevents a "High" confidence assessment, the existing links are significant.

**Newly Discovered IOCs:**
- **IPs:**
  - `89.111.170.193`
  - `152.42.139.18`
  - `134.209.139.11`
- **Domains:**
  - `d.ninja-browser.com`
- **URLs:** None

**Recommended Next Steps:**
- Hand off to the Strategic Campaign Intelligence Analyst for final synthesis. Further investigation is required to determine if other malicious domains are hosted on the identified IP addresses, which could reveal the broader scope of the "NinjaBrowser" campaign. The tool limitations in this investigation should be noted.
