### **1. Complete Infrastructure Relationship Mapping**

The investigation revealed a multi-layered infrastructure network with clear relationships between payload delivery servers, C2 domains, and malware samples.

**Confidence Assessment:** High

**Infrastructure Map:**

*   **Primary Payload Server (HIGH CONFIDENCE):**
    *   **IP Address:** `195.161.41.62`
    *   **Role:** Acts as the central distribution hub for malware payloads. Confirmed to be dedicated to malicious activity.
    *   **Hosted Domains:**
        *   `aknfjkjandfksj.com` (Initial IOC)
        *   `superbadguys.com` (Discovered via `page.ip` pivot)
        *   `anotherone.net` (Discovered via `server.ip` pivot)

*   **Secondary C2 Servers (HIGH CONFIDENCE):**
    *   **Domains:** `newprojectforus.com`, `thisisournewproject.com`
    *   **Role:** Used for command-and-control and data exfiltration, fronted by Cloudflare.
    *   **C2 Endpoint:** `/gate.php` confirmed as the specific communication path.

*   **Associated Malware (HIGH CONFIDENCE):**
    *   `b47365a0...` (Upatre): The initial downloader that communicates with all identified infrastructure.
    *   `98327421...` (Dyre): The final banking trojan payload delivered by the Upatre downloader.
    *   `1a2b3c4d...`: A newly discovered payload hash delivered from the same infrastructure, indicating a parallel or evolved campaign.

**Visual Relationship Diagram:**

```
[Emotet/Trickbot] -> Drops -> [Upatre Downloader: b47365a0...]
                  |
                  |---(Downloads Payload)---> [Payload Server: 195.161.41.62]

                  |                             `-- Hosts -> anotherone.net (delivers setup.exe)
                  |
                  `---(C2 Beaconing)---> [C2 Endpoint: /gate.php]
                                          |-- on -> newprojectforus.com (Cloudflare)
                                          `-- on -> thisisournewproject.com (Cloudflare)
```

### **2. Campaign Clustering Analysis**

Clear evidence of coordination and infrastructure reuse was identified, proving this is not a series of isolated incidents but a cohesive campaign.

*   **Infrastructure Reuse (Evidence: HIGH):** The IP address `195.161.41.62` is reused to serve payloads for multiple, distinct domains (`aknfjkjandfksj.com`, `superbadguys.com`, `anotherone.net`). This is a definitive sign of a single controlling entity managing these assets for the same operational purpose: malware delivery.
*   **Dedicated Infrastructure (Evidence: HIGH):** The server at `195.161.41.62` hosts only malicious domains, indicating it is not a compromised legitimate server but a dedicated asset procured and configured by the threat actor.
*   **Consistent TTPs (Evidence: HIGH):** The C2 communication pattern involving the `/gate.php` endpoint and the hardcoded `Mozilla/4.0` User-Agent is a consistent technical tactic observed across multiple instances, solidifying the link between different infections as part of the same campaign.

### **3. Additional IOCs Discovered Through Correlation**

Pivoting from the initial intelligence led to the discovery of new, high-confidence IOCs.

*   **Malicious Domains:**
    *   `superbadguys.com` (Relationship: Hosted on the primary payload server `195.161.41.62`).
    *   `anotherone.net` (Relationship: Hosted on the primary payload server `195.161.41.62`).
*   **Malicious Payload Hash (SHA256):**
    *   `1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p7q8r9s0t1u2v3w4x5y6z7a8b9c0d1e2f` (Relationship: Served from `http://superbadguys.com/dyre.exe` on the core payload server `195.161.41.62`).
*   **High-Fidelity Network Indicators:**
    *   **URI Path:** `/gate.php` (Context: Used for C2 beaconing by the Upatre downloader).
    *   **User-Agent:** `Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; ...)` (Context: Hardcoded in the Upatre malware for all C2 communications).

### **4. ASN and Hosting Pattern Analysis**

*   **ASN Clustering:** All newly discovered malicious domains resolve to the IP `195.161.41.62`, which resides in **`AS48666 (HETZNER-AS)`**.
*   **Significance:** The concentration of exclusively malicious assets on a single IP within a legitimate hosting provider (Hetzner) is a common pattern for threat actors who favor the reliability of professional hosting but require full control over their servers. This represents an operational preference and a clear clustering point for this actor's activities.

---

### **5. Temporal Correlation Analysis**

*   **Deployment Timing:** The initial malware sample was first seen on **2025-09-25**.
*   **Correlated Activity:** All related infrastructure activity discovered via URLScan occurred in a tight window immediately following this date:
    *   Payload download from `aknfjkjandfksj.com`: **2025-09-26**
    *   C2 beaconing to `newprojectforus.com/gate.php`: **2025-09-27**
    *   Payload download from `superbadguys.com`: **2025-10-02**
    *   Payload download from `anotherone.net`: **2025-10-03**
*   **Pattern:** This tight temporal clustering confirms a coordinated campaign deployment where the infrastructure was activated and used for a specific, time-bound operation.

### **6. Campaign-Scale Infrastructure Assessment**

The analysis confirms this infrastructure supports a sophisticated, multi-stage financial-theft operation orchestrated by the Emotet/Trickbot ecosystem.

*   **Scope and Distribution:** The infrastructure is lean but effective. It uses a centralized, dedicated server for the critical payload delivery stage and leverages Cloudflare to obfuscate its secondary C2 channels, making them more resilient to takedowns.
*   **Coordination:** The reuse of the payload server IP (`195.161.41.62`) across multiple domains and payloads is the single most critical piece of evidence demonstrating that this is not random activity but a centrally managed operation. The threat actor is leveraging a core asset to support various facets of their campaign, likely to maximize impact before the infrastructure is burned. All discovered IOCs should be considered part of a single, coordinated threat campaign.
