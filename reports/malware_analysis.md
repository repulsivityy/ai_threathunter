### Deep Malware Behavioral Analysis: 5329d4b1d8aa6b3e90176927c2597f28c7173f9293304504f9c3a426c821c93d
- **Key Behavioral Findings**: The malware operates as a multi-stage dropper packaged as an Inno Setup installer. It downloads and installs a Chromium-based browser named "NinjaBrowser". It establishes persistence by creating two scheduled tasks set to run with the highest privileges. Key suspicious activity includes hijacking file associations for web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) and common file types (.html, .pdf) to force the use of its installed browser.
- **Suspicious Activity**: 
    - **Persistence via Scheduled Tasks:** Creates two scheduled tasks, "NinjaBrowserUpdate" and "NinjaBrowserUpdateLog," using `schtasks.exe`. These tasks run `updater.exe` daily and at user logon with high privileges, ensuring the malware's components remain active and updated.
    - **File Association Hijacking:** Spawns `def.exe`, which in turn executes `mshta.exe` with `.hta` files. This technique is used to modify registry keys and hijack the default handlers for `.html`, `.htm`, `.pdf`, `http`, and `https` to its own installed browser ("ChromiumHTM"), effectively forcing all web traffic and document viewing through its software.
    - **Payload Delivery:** The initial executable downloads further payloads (`mini_installer.exe`, `NinjaBrowser.exe`) from `d.ninja-browser.com`. This confirms its role as a downloader.
    - **Defense Evasion:** The malware deletes its executable components from the `%TEMP%` directory after execution to clean up its tracks. It also employs anti-analysis techniques such as having a `.tls` section and potentially checking for sandbox environments via time-based checks.
- **Threat Classification**: **Adware/PUP Dropper**. The malware's primary goal is to deceptively install the "NinjaBrowser" software and force its usage by hijacking file and protocol associations. The bundling of numerous browser extensions is a classic characteristic of Adware and Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs). There are also indicators of potential information-stealing capabilities, such as SQL strings related to "password_notes".
- **Infrastructure Indicators**:
    - **Primary Domain:** `d.ninja-browser.com` (Used for downloading payloads)
    - **Resolved IPs:** `152.42.139.18`, `89.111.170.193`, `134.209.139.11`
    - **Other DNS Lookups for Investigation:** `api.quicknodelink.com`, `lbpx.pathway-link.com`, `ublockorigin.pages.dev`, `malware-filter.pages.dev`
- **Attack Chain Analysis**: 
    1.  The initial executable (`setup.exe`), an Inno Setup installer, is run by the user.
    2.  It drops and executes a temporary file (`file.tmp`) in `%AppData%\Local\Temp`.
    3.  `file.tmp` connects to `d.ninja-browser.com` to download the main payloads, including `NinjaBrowser.exe` and `mini_installer.exe`.
    4.  It executes dropped components like `chromium.exe` and `def.exe` from the temp folder.
    5.  `def.exe` uses `mshta.exe` to modify file associations in the registry.
    6.  The malware uses `schtasks.exe` to create scheduled tasks for persistence, pointing to an `updater.exe` placed in `C:\Program Files (x86)\NinjaBrowser`.
    7.  Finally, it installs the "NinjaBrowser" application and cleans up the temporary files.
- **Contextual Insights**: The malware is identified as "Trojan:ninjasor", which aligns with its behavior as a Trojan that installs unwanted software. The packaging as an installer for a supposed custom browser is a common social engineering tactic to trick users into installing adware.

-----
**Verdict:** **Malicious**
**Justification:** The file is a malicious dropper that uses deceptive methods to install a Potentially Unwanted Program ("NinjaBrowser"). It establishes persistent control over the system via high-privilege scheduled tasks and hijacks user file and protocol associations to redirect traffic. It downloads additional payloads from a remote server and actively attempts to evade analysis by deleting its components post-execution.
**Recommended Action:** **Hand off to Adversary Infra Hunting Agent**
