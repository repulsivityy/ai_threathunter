### Deep Malware Behavioral Analysis Report
**Malware Identity:**
*   **Hash:** `3553d068f85437c23d08d89cac57fa70f78c50eb4ed3c032c37003b99cafc627`
*   **Classification:** **Dropper / Backdoor Implant** (LOGICBURST family)
*   **TTPs:**
    *   T1218: System Binary Proxy Execution (Rundll32, Regsvr32)
    *   T1053.005: Scheduled Task/Job (Persistence)
    *   T1036.005: Match Legitimate Name or Location (Masquerading as "AhnlabUpdate")
    *   T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer (C2 Communication)
    *   TA0007: Discovery
    *   TA0011: Command and Control

**Attack Chain:**
1.  **Execution (Dropper):** The initial sample (`3553d068f85437c23d08d89cac57fa70f78c50eb4ed3c032c37003b99cafc627`) acts as a dropper. Upon execution, it writes two malicious DLL files to disk (`init.dll` and `readme.dll`).
2.  **Payload Execution & Defense Evasion:** The dropper uses legitimate Windows utilities ("Living Off the Land" binaries) to execute the malicious payload. Specifically, it uses `rundll32.exe` and `regsvr32.exe` to load and run functions within the dropped DLLs. This technique helps evade simple detection mechanisms that focus on purely malicious executable names.
3.  **Persistence:** The malware establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task named `AhnlabUpdate`. This task is configured to re-execute the malicious DLL, ensuring the implant survives reboots. The name is a clear attempt at masquerading, mimicking a legitimate security product from AhnLab, a popular vendor in the targeted region (South Korea).
4.  **C2 Communication:** The executed payload performs a DNS lookup for `load.serverpit.com`. This domain serves as the Command and Control (C2) server. The implant will likely beacon out to this server to receive further instructions, download additional modules, or exfiltrate stolen data.

**Network Indicators for Follow-up:**
*   **Primary C2 Domain:** `load.serverpit.com`
*   **Benign/Noise Domains:** `ecs-office.s-0005.dual-s-msedge.net`, `s-0005.dual-s-msedge.net`, `nexusrules.officeapps.live.com` (These are likely noise from Microsoft services but should be noted.)
*   **Dropped File Hashes:**
    *   `0998c777583412861d2c505e918d60729ef38ce1333b396c0337c585e4f5d9dd`
    *   `8b28f2eb80c05fdfac7f92d9598ef412387fa44406118089a43230747ccb6544`

**Verdict:**
**MALICIOUS - ESPIONAGE IMPLANT (BACKDOOR)**. The behavioral evidence strongly supports the initial assessment. This file is a dropper for the LOGICBURST backdoor, used by the APT group UNC6492. Its purpose is to establish a persistent foothold on a target system, likely for long-term espionage, data exfiltration, and lateral movement, consistent with the known objectives of this threat actor.
