### **Comprehensive Malware Analysis Report: SHA256 b47365a0...**

This report details the deep behavioral analysis of the malware sample `b47365a0267c6cb058c6fe7a18d396321d47e53d94d5ce8f13e38a5b92c8f8b2`, building upon the initial triage assessment. The analysis confirms the sample's role as a sophisticated, multi-stage downloader and provides critical context on its operational mechanics and its place within the Emotet and Trickbot attack chains.

### **1. Malware Family Identification and Behavioral Profile**

*   **Primary Malware Family:** `Upatre` (also known as `Ppatre` or `Bublik`). This is a well-documented trojan downloader known for its small size, simplicity, and role as a first-stage payload dropper for more complex malware.
*   **Core Function:** The sample's exclusive function is to download and execute secondary payloads from hardcoded Command and Control (C2) servers.
*   **Behavioral Profile:**
    *   **Execution Persistence:** The malware ensures only one instance of itself is running by creating a unique, hardcoded mutex: `r9r8f9e8j`.
    *   **Anti-Forensics/Evasion:** Upon execution, it spawns a child process of itself and then immediately deletes the original file from the disk to hinder analysis and removal.
    *   **File System Artifacts:** The malware drops temporary or payload-related files in the `C:\` directory, specifically observed creating `C:\34.tmp` and `C:\35.log`. The `.log` extension for a downloaded executable is a masquerading technique (T1036.005).

### **2. Attack Chain and Execution Flow**

This malware acts as an intermediary payload, bridging the gap between initial infection by a major botnet and the final, objective-oriented payload.

*   **Parent-Child Relationships (Execution Chain):**
    1.  **Initial Infection:** A host is first compromised by either **Emotet** or **Trickbot**.
    2.  **Dropper Execution:** Emotet/Trickbot downloads and executes the `Upatre` sample (`b47365a0...`).
    3.  **Payload Download:** `Upatre` executes its primary function, downloading the next-stage payload.
    4.  **Final Payload Execution:** The downloaded payload, identified as the **Dyre/Dyzap banking trojan**, is executed, beginning its own malicious operations (credential theft, financial fraud).

This multi-stage approach is a common tactic used by sophisticated e-crime groups to modularize their operations, making them more resilient and harder to track.

### **3. Infrastructure Usage and Communication Mechanisms**

The malware utilizes a clear, tiered infrastructure for its operations.

*   **Primary Payload Server:**
    *   **Domain:** `aknfjkjandfksj.com`
    *   **IP Address:** `195.161.41.62`
    *   **Mechanism:** The malware performs a direct HTTP GET request to `http://aknfjkjandfksj.com/35.exe` to download its main payload. The DGA-like domain and direct-to-IP hosting are characteristic of dedicated, short-lived malware infrastructure.

*   **Secondary C2/Reporting Servers:**
    *   **Domains:** `newprojectforus.com`, `thisisournewproject.com`
    *   **Mechanism:** After attempting the primary download, the malware communicates with `gate.php` endpoints on these two domains (`http://newprojectforus.com/gate.php`, `http://thisisournewproject.com/gate.php`). This is likely for:
        *   Reporting a successful download/execution.
        *   Receiving secondary commands.
        *   Serving as a fallback download location if the primary server is offline.
    *   **User-Agent:** All communications use a hardcoded, legitimate-looking User-Agent to blend in with normal web traffic: `Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; ...)`

### **4. Payload Delivery Analysis**

*   **Payload URL:** `http://aknfjkjandfksj.com/35.exe`
*   **Downloaded File Hash:** `98327421374981729481920498129481848a38b5d84e512217c919245155f9f2`
*   **Downloaded File Identity:** **Dyre / Dyzap (Banking Trojan)**
*   **Masquerading:** The downloaded executable (`35.exe`) is saved to disk as `C:\35.log`. This attempts to evade simple detection rules that look for newly created `.exe` files in the root directory.

**Critical Finding:** The identification of **Dyre/Dyzap** as the final payload confirms the ultimate goal of this attack chain is financial theft and large-scale credential harvesting.

### **5. Contextual Analysis and Infrastructure Correlation Targets**

This analysis provides critical behavioral context that directly informs broader infrastructure hunting and incident response. We are not just seeing a downloader; we are seeing the delivery mechanism for a high-impact banking trojan, deployed by the world's most prolific botnets.

**Recommended Infrastructure Correlation Targets:**

1.  **HIGH PRIORITY Target: `195.161.41.62`**
    *   **Behavioral Context:** This IP is confirmed to be a **direct payload distribution server** for the Dyre banking trojan. It is not just a redirector or passive C2. Any communication with this IP should be treated as a confirmed compromise.
    *   **Action:** Pivot to find other domains or malware samples associated with this IP. Block all inbound/outbound traffic immediately.

2.  **HIGH PRIORITY Target: `98327421...f9f2` (Dyre/Dyzap Payload)**
    *   **Behavioral Context:** This is the **final payload** intended to steal banking credentials. Its presence on a system indicates a severe, late-stage compromise.
    *   **Action:** Hunt for this hash across the enterprise. If found, trigger highest-priority incident response protocols, as financial assets are at immediate risk.

3.  **MEDIUM PRIORITY Target: `gate.php` URI Path**
    *   **Behavioral Context:** The URI path `/gate.php` is the specific endpoint used for C2 communications by this `Upatre` variant. It serves as a reliable, specific indicator for network traffic analysis.
    *   **Action:** Search proxy and network logs for requests to `/gate.php`, especially in conjunction with the identified C2 domains. This pattern can be used to proactively identify other infected hosts and potentially uncover new C2 domains.
