### Deep Malware Behavioral Analysis: 5329d4b1d8aa6b3e90176927c2597f28c7173f9293304504f9c3a426c821c93d
- **Key Behavioral Findings**: Analysis was inconclusive due to a tool error. The `GTI Deep Analysis Tool` failed to retrieve the behavioral summary.
- **Suspicious Activity**: Unable to determine specific suspicious activities due to the tool failure. The initial triage identified the file as `trojan.ninjasor`.
- **Threat Classification**: Based on initial triage, the threat is classified as a Trojan. Detailed behavioral classification (e.g., ransomware, infostealer) is not possible without the deep analysis report.
- **Infrastructure Indicators**: No network infrastructure indicators could be identified.
- **Attack Chain Analysis**: The attack chain cannot be determined from the available data.
- **Contextual Insights**: The initial triage report indicates the file is a widespread Trojan detected by Google's spam and threat filtering engines.
-----
**Verdict:** **Malicious**
**Justification:** The verdict is based on the initial triage report, which shows a GTI verdict of MALICIOUS, a detection ratio of 22/77, and classification as `trojan.ninjasor`. However, a deep behavioral analysis, crucial for understanding the malware's full impact and intent, could not be completed due to a tool failure (`GTI Deep Analysis Tool` failed with a 'destination_port' error).
**Recommended Action:** **Escalate to a human Tier 2 Analyst**
