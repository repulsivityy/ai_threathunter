### Deep Malware Behavioral Analysis: 69934dc1d4fdb552037774ee7a75c20608c09680128c9840b508551dbcf463ad
- **Key Behavioral Findings**: The malware establishes a foothold on the system by creating persistence through suspicious "updater.exe" files in non-standard directories within `C:\Program Files`. It performs system reconnaissance by querying hardware and application inventory registry keys. The sample initiates outbound network connections to multiple IP addresses over standard web ports (80, 443), likely for command-and-control (C2) communication or to download a second-stage payload.
- **Suspicious Activity**:
    - **Masquerading:** The malware creates multiple processes named `updater.exe` within uniquely named directories like `C:\Program Files\Google2712_744651379\bin\`. This is a clear attempt to masquerade as a legitimate Google Updater process to evade detection and achieve persistence.
    - **Abuse of Application Frameworks:** The malware reads files named `resources.neu` and `neutralino.config.json`. This indicates the malware is packaged using the Neutralinojs framework, which allows developers to build applications with web technologies. Threat actors often abuse these frameworks to package and execute malicious scripts, bypassing traditional security controls.
    - **System Reconnaissance:** The malware accesses and modifies registry keys related to `InventoryApplication` and `InventoryDevicePnp`, indicating it is gathering detailed information about the host's software and hardware configuration.
- **Threat Classification**: **Downloader / Trojan**. The observed behaviors—establishing persistence, gathering system information, and initiating outbound network connections—are characteristic of a first-stage payload. Its primary purpose is to secure access to the compromised system and download additional malicious modules. It does not exhibit behaviors typical of ransomware or wipers.
- **Infrastructure Indicators**:
    - `20.99.133.109:443`
    - `20.69.140.28:443`
    - `23.55.140.42:80`
    - `184.27.218.92:80`
    - `23.213.37.172:80`
    - `23.196.145.221:80`
- **Attack Chain Analysis**: The malware is executed from the user's desktop, suggesting delivery via phishing or a malicious web download. Upon execution, it masquerades as a legitimate updater, establishes persistence, and enumerates system details. It then reaches out to its C2 infrastructure (the suspicious IPs listed above) to receive further commands or download the next-stage payload, which could be anything from a stealer to ransomware.
- **Contextual Insights**: The use of the Neutralinojs framework is a notable technique for evading static analysis, as the malicious logic is often contained within the web-based resources (`.neu` file) rather than the executable itself. The initial triage associated this with `trojan.calendaino`, which aligns with downloader/trojan behavior.
-----
**Verdict:** **Malicious**
**Justification:** The malware exhibits multiple definitive malicious behaviors, including masquerading as a legitimate updater for persistence, performing system reconnaissance, and making outbound connections to suspected C2 infrastructure. These actions confirm its role as a first-stage trojan designed to compromise a system and facilitate further infection.
**Recommended Action:** **Hand off to Adversary Infra Hunting Agent**
