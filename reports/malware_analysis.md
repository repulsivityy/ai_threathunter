### Deep Malware Behavioral Analysis: 5329d4b1d8aa6b3e90176927c2597f28c7173f28c7173f9293304504f9c3a426c821c93d
- **Key Behavioral Findings**: The malware operates as a multi-stage dropper, identified as an Inno Setup installer. Its primary function is to download and install a Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP) named "NinjaBrowser". It establishes persistence by creating two scheduled tasks (`NinjaBrowserUpdate` and `NinjaBrowserUpdateLog`) that run with the highest privileges. The malware downloads a second-stage payload from a hardcoded domain and exhibits information-stealing behavior by accessing browser history and cookie files.
- **Suspicious Activity**: 
    - **Persistence:** Creates two scheduled tasks using `schtasks.exe` to run `updater.exe` daily and at logon with `HIGHEST` privileges.
    - **Payload Delivery:** Connects to `d.ninja-browser.com` to download `version.txt` and a second-stage executable payload (`mini_installer.exe`).
    - **Dropper Behavior:** The initial sample drops multiple executables (`chromium.exe`, `def.exe`, `file.tmp`) into the `%TEMP%` directory and executes them. It then deletes these files to cover its tracks.
    - **LOLBAS Abuse:** Utilizes `mshta.exe` to execute `.hta` files from the Temp directory, a known defense evasion technique.
    - **Information Stealing:** Shows signs of being an infostealer by accessing browser history and files related to cookies. SQL strings related to password storage were found in memory dumps.
    - **System Hijacking:** Modifies file associations for `.html`, `.htm`, and `.pdf` files to `ChromiumHTM`, hijacking the user's default application settings.
- **Threat Classification**: **Adware/PUP Dropper with Infostealer Capabilities**. The primary goal is to install the "NinjaBrowser" adware and establish persistence. The secondary goal is to steal user information from browsers. The popular threat name `trojan.ninjasor` is consistent with this type of threat.
- **Infrastructure Indicators**:
    - **Domain:** `d.ninja-browser.com`
    - **IP Addresses:** `89.111.170.193`, `152.42.139.18`, `134.209.139.11`
- **Attack Chain Analysis**: 
    1.  The initial executable (an Inno Setup installer) is run.
    2.  It drops `file.tmp`, `chromium.exe`, and `def.exe` into a temporary directory and executes them.
    3.  `file.tmp` communicates with the C2 domain `d.ninja-browser.com` to download the next stage payload, `mini_installer.exe`.
    4.  The malware installs "NinjaBrowser" and creates two scheduled tasks for persistence.
    5.  `def.exe` and `mshta.exe` are used to hijack file associations.
    6.  The malware deletes the temporary files it dropped.
- **Contextual Insights**: The malware masquerades as a legitimate installer. The use of Inno Setup, scheduled tasks for persistence, and downloading payloads from a C2 are common TTPs for adware and PUP droppers. The "NinjaBrowser" name is associated with known adware campaigns.
-----
**Verdict:** **Malicious**
**Justification:** The file acts as a dropper for adware/PUP, establishes high-privilege persistence via scheduled tasks, communicates with a malicious domain to download additional payloads, and exhibits information-stealing behaviors. These actions are unequivocally malicious and pose a significant risk to the user's security and privacy.
**Recommended Action:** **Hand off to Infrastructure Analysis Agent**
